# TCP

Apache Pekko Streams provides a way of handling **TCP connections** with streams. While the general approach is very similar to the Actor based TCP handling using Apache Pekko IO, by using Apache Pekko Streams you are freed of having to manually react to back-pressure signals, as the library does it transparently for you.


## Apache Pekko TCP

Apache Pekko comes with its Reactive Streams-compliant TCP server and client.
Learn more about it in the [Apache Pekko Streaming TCP documentation](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/stream/stream-io.html#streaming-tcp).
