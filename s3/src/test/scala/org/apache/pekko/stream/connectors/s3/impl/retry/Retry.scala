   * retrying using a predicate, if it should retry an exponential back off is applied so that the retry waits longer
   * and longer for every retry it makes. A jitter is also added so that the exact timing of the retry isn't exactly
   * the same for all calls with the same backOffUnit
   *
   * Any exception in the block creating the future will also be returned as a failed future Default is to retry for
   * all throwables.
